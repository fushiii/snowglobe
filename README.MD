# These are my NixOS config files. Not sure if it will work on your pc, so thread lightly.


## How to install:

After you already have flakes, use:
```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .# 
```

on the snowglobe folder

## Important:

  After adding any new flakes(.nix files), do ```git ad . ``` or else the build WILL fail.
